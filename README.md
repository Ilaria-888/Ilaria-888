## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm a self-taught web developer!

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mastering my web development skills.
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Python to strengthen my coding arsenal.
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not looking to collaborate just yet, as Iâ€™m focused on creating projects independently.
âš¡ Fun fact: My educational background is completely unrelated to programming, but I made the leap because itâ€™s never too late to change paths!
